Purpose of polymorphism is 
->  share it's features to child class (by means of inheritance)
->  same name different object different actions



We can say 3 types of class based inheritance polymorphism (virtual, =0)

1) base class with all concrete functions

2) base class some concrete function and some virtual fucntions

3) base class with all pure virtual functions- abstract class
